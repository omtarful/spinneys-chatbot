Founder and visionary Michel de Bustros undertakes massive works to implant Château Kefraya’s vineyards on those magnificent hillsides. The first vines are planted in 1951 and in 1979 - despite the Lebanese civil war (1975-1990) - Château Kefraya starts producing its own wine with its own grapes grown in its own vineyard and vinified in its own cellar. In the early 80’s, “Les Coteaux de Kefraya” 1982 and 1983 win the winery’s first international medals and Château Kefraya starts exporting its wines to France. In 1997, American wine critic Robert Parker awards Comte de M 1996 91/100, qualifying it “An amazing accomplishment in Lebanon”. Today, Château Kefraya is present in more than 40 countries over the five continents.',\n",

This style gave Champagne the reputation for premium quality it heralds to this day. François Montand offers a great tasting sparkling wine, made in the Méthode Traditionnelle, at a value. With an elegant, classic French label, François Montand introduces more people to this winemaking style, showing wine lovers everywhere that a well-made, high quality sparkling wine can be accessible. The quality of François Montand wines start in the vineyard with a rigorous selection of the best grapes. Adhering to the strict standards of Méthode Traditionnelle, François Montand wines are crafted with the utmost care and precision, resulting in light-bodied, yet textured and complex sparkling wines.

In 1843, the Chivas brothers were awarded the first of many Royal Warrants by Queen Victoria to supply goods and provisions to the Royal Household. In the 1850s, James and John Chivas combined soft grain whisky and robust single malts to create Blended Scotch. In 1909, Chivas Regal was launched as the world’s first luxury whisky. A 25 year old luxury blend that became afterwards a highly sought-after collector’s item, due to World War I and the Prohibition era events. In the early 1950s Chivas Regal 12 got released. A premium blend of whiskies, each aged for at least 12 years. Over the next few decades, the smooth honeyed flavors of Chivas Regal became a global icon. In 1997, Master Blender Colin Scott created Chivas Regal 18 Year Old Gold Signature. It quickly grew into a multi-award winning new blend. Nearly a century after its first break through, in 2007, Chivas Regal 25 year old held a limited release.
